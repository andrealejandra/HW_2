#1st Portfolio Update

##Intro
 Looking back at my first attempt at creating an HTML site with Bootstrap styling, I am now able to see the problems I encountered with Bootstrap grid. A few container adjustments helped me get a more visually pleasing format.
 
 ##Updates
 The "About Me" section has been updated to reflect my current personal statement, and the formatting is improved.
 I have included a preview to my first project with links to deployment and the repo on Github.

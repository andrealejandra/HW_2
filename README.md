#Intro

I've made this site to be (mostly) functional and visually displeasing. There are so many things that I wish I could've done asthetically, but I have laid the foundation. It took days to figure out that I couldn't just rely on the concepts I fully understood because the example photos show a full integration of the entire spectrum of organic CSS to the the conventional layouts of Bootsrap anyone with a screen ~ 640x1136 px can identify.

##Layer 1

The most fundamental and easiest piece of the cake, at this point, is creating the branch of files that all link together to ease navigation. This is why the navbar is where I started to link all of my pages to flip page-to-page from the same standard top menu. The Copyright footer at the bottom was even more simple -- aside from styling. The trick here was realizing I NEEDED the JS links.

##Layer 2

This consisted of creating the framework for what the layout was meant to be, which began with filling div containers with their appropriate constituents (based on the required grid). The index was just one main container. The portfolio is one main container filled with 3 row containers and 2 columns to (almost) create the 3 x 2 grid visible on lg-sized screens -- otherwise they colapse to sit one on another to be viewed one by one on mobile screens.

##Layer 3

I darn near broke everything on this step. The photos I had added in my portfolio grid went bye-bye when I FINALLY figured out the CSS reset was vital in my pursuit of customizing the Boostrap content. I sacrificed the beautiful but bland site for a dumpster fire with a nice font and pretty colors.

##Layer 4

This is where I got caught and realized element positioning is harder than watering carrots and scooting frogs to lily pads. I got stuck trying to figure out the best way to marry the text that was supposed to float gracefully over my (now broken) images. At least there are games for this skill...
